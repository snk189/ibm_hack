# Setu

Setu is a web app that acts as the ears and mouth of a deaf or non-verbal person on an official phone call (electricity board, bank, hospital, cyber helpline 1930). The clerk uses a normal phone and installs nothing.

See [`AGENTS.md`](AGENTS.md) for the full product contract and [`TEAM_GUIDE.md`](TEAM_GUIDE.md) for team responsibilities.

## Getting started

```bash
cp .env.local.example .env.local  # fill in your API keys
npm install
npm run dev   # starts the custom server (handles WebSocket + Next.js)
```

## Environment variables
